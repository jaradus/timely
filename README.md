TIMELY

tick…  tick….  tick…  TIMELY the clickless location & time-based search

Project Scope
A mobile discovery tool, Timely pushes temporally curates  selections 
Based on time of day, geolocation, and user preferences, Timely provides users with tailored service recommendations
The user will be able to search for things to do with as little as no clicks based on their location and what they have pre-configured (by default, the system is capable of providing no-click results based simply on Geolocation).
The user has defaults defined that are saved along with the user record that will be used for each search unless the user enters other data for an immediate search. 

Details
Mobile Interface
Mobile version is ultra-simplified.  Default action when a page get at ‘/’ is received from the user is to load a page with search search results per their pre-configured settings.
is that when the user selects a page

Desktop Interface (aka wide display)
Default action will be same as with Mobile phone.
User is able to configure general search keywords associated with different times of day.
Location is determined via an HTML5 technique.  Note: The user must pre-approve TIMELY to access their smartphone/desktop web browser’s location information
Features
ICEBOX? At pre-arranged times, the app can be configured to send search results to the user. (what would keep this from being the same day-after day?)
ICEBOX: What about a calendaring functionality that the user can ask for search results to be sent at a given date/time to them when they’ll know they want them?  Is that even a useful functionality?
While on mobile, user is texted top three results based on established search criteria
eg: the user can set up default searches for the AM hours, 11am-5pm, 5pm-10pm, and “late night”.  The default search keywords for AM hours might include “coffee” “bagels” “train delays”, the afternoon search might include “food truck” “massage groupon”.  Evening search might include “train delays for Green line” “chinese delivery”.  Late night search might include “clubs with salsa music” “after-bar menu” “hookah”

Those who might most-benefit from this app
Traveling salesperson who has similar NEEDS during different times of the day, but different LOCATIONS
...the thought occurred to me that our DEFAULT settings (in providing the initial search results) are going to get really boring to people who always work in the same location
